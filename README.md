This project focuses on analyzing the IMDB Movies dataset to understand the factors that 
contribute to a movie's success, measured by its IMDB rating. The goal is to provide actionable 
insights for movie producers, directors, and investors to make informed decisions in future 
movie projects. By investigating variables such as genre, duration, language, director, and 
budget, the analysis aims to uncover relationships and trends that influence movie ratings and 
financial success.
